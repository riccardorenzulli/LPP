       c) select the last element of a non-empty list

{- 1) Without looking at the standard prelude, define
      the following library functions using recursion:
      a) Decide if all logical values in a list are true:
           and :: [Bool] -> Bool
      b) Concatenate a list of lists:
           concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
      c) Produce a list with n identical elements:
           replicate :: Int -> a -> [a]
      d) Select the nth element of a list:
           (!!) :: [a] -> Int -> a
      e) Decide if a value is an element of a list:
           elem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool

{- 2) Define a recursive function
        merge :: [Int] -> [Int] -> [Int]
      that merges two sorted lists of integers to give
      a single sorted list. For example:

      > [1,2,3,4,5,6]

{- 3) Define a recursive function
        msort :: [Int] -> [Int]
      that implements merge sort, which can be
      specified by the following two rules:
      Lists of length <= 1 are already sorted;
      Other lists can be sorted by sorting the two
      halves and merging the resulting lists.
